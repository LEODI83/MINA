"Top-50" Validators, per time period July-December 2022

Just tracking the **dynamics** of mining blocks of top-50 Validators using the [Figment](https://hubble.figment.io/mina/chains/mainnet) scanner
But this is not a correct top, because they take into account the **total sum** of all blocks mined by the validator for the entire time - although this is also an interesting indicator.

But the dynamics are interested in the "behavior" of the Validator during a certain period

For example, for the current month *MinaExplorer* - takes the 3rd place in the extraction of blocks and already next month it will probably get the 4th place in the Figment table (where the **sum of blocks** for all time is reflected)
But this does not mean that this Validator is the most profitable.
For example, over the last week, *StakewithJenni* were the best validators in terms **of growth rate**.
(This example from September, 21 2021)

But nobody knows what will happen next. 

For our analysis, it will be required, in addition to the Figment explorer,
data of delegations from the Mina Foundations - top-120 delegations - [UpTime](http://uptime.minaprotocol.com/), which change at random time and must be monitored in order not to lose profit.
[MinaExplorer](https://minaexplorer.com/) Data, also.
